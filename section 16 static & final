static keyword
--------------


There are 

1) static variables
2) static Methods
3) static Nested class
4) static Blocks


-> Static	Keyword	is	used	for	representing	Meta	Data	(data	about	data).	
• It	is	useful	for	representing	the	information	of	a	class.	(not about the objects, though objects can share the information) 
• Static	members	belongs	to	a	class	and	they	can	be	shared	by	all	the	
objects	of	the	class	and	all	the	objects	have	their	own	non-static	
members	.	
• All	the	object	can	use	the	static	variable	as	a	shared	data.	
• Static	members	can	be	accessed	just	by	using	class	name.	
• The	static	members	of	a	class	are	created	in	the	method	area(they are available once the class is loaded).	
• Static	methods	can	access	only	static	members.	


-> If a data related to class then we can use static variables.
-> If data needs some processing & if we want to do computations, & then we can use static methods
-> If we have lot of data & that can be grouped together, and made it as nested class.



static variables:
1) static variables belongs to a class
2) It will be shared by all objects, there will be only one copy (or) instance of the static variable common for all the objects.
3) they are created in method area.
4) they can be used as a  shared data member by all the objects, they can be accessed by using the object name as well as they can access by class name. 



static methods:
1) static methods belongs to a class
2) static methods are common for all the objects.
3) they can called & just used by class name.(we dont have to create the object, even if we create object & acess with object there is no problem)
4) static methods can only access static members. It cannot access non static members(instance members).





Example Program:


class practice
{

static int x=10;
int y=20;

	void show()   //instance method
	{
	System.out.println(x+" "+y); //non static method allows, static content & non static content... 
	}

	static void display()
	{
	System.out.println(x+" "+y);   // but static method allows only, static content(static method cannot access non static members i.e., y)
	}

}

class test
{

public static void main(String arg[])

{
	practice p=new practice();
	p.show();
	p.display();

}
}
